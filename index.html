        <h1>FB</h1>

        <p>
            Hey, I'm FB (shorter of my real name) and it is my personal website in the dark web. <br>
            I'm a Software Engineer, I love writing code and I am always looking for new things to learn. <br>
            <q>As seen on TV</q> is a quote from very famous videogame, do you know which?
        </p>

        <h3>Why on the dark web?</h3>
        <p>
            I've ventured into the depths of the dark web to showcase my prowess as a seasoned 
            software engineer specializing in the development of intricate web applications. 
            This clandestine endeavor serves as a unique platform for me to unveil the depth 
            of my skills and expertise. Through this hidden corner of the internet, I aim to 
            present cutting-edge capabilities in web development that may not be suitable 
            for mainstream channels. <br><br>

            By navigating the shadows, I aspire to push the boundaries of what is conventionally 
            seen, demonstrating my ability to create and handle complex applications that 
            thrive in the clandestine corners of the digital realm. This initiative is not 
            merely a showcase; it's a testament to the innovation and sophistication that can 
            be achieved in the hands of a skilled developer. <br><br>
            
            As I tread the paths less traveled, I invite those with an appreciation for the 
            obscure to witness the fusion of technology and artistry that defines 
            my creations in this covert digital space. This venture into the dark web is a 
            deliberate choice to challenge norms and redefine the perception of web development 
            expertise.
